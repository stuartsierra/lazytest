  "Sets metadata on function f identifying it as a test case.  A test
  case function may execute arbitrary code and may have side effects.
  It should throw an exception to indicate failure.  Returning without
  throwing an exception indicates success.

  Additional identifying metadata may be placed on the function, such
  as :name and :doc.

  Test case functions may have before/after metadata (see
  lazytest.wrap).  The 'before' function must be executed *before* the
  test case function is executed.  The 'after' function must be
  executed *after* the test case function is executed, regardless of
  whether or not the test case function was successful.  Executing the
  before/after functions is the responsibility of the test runner."
